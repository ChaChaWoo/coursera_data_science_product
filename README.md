# coursera_data_science_product
This repo contains the server.R and ui.R files for a Data Product developed for the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

The code is designed to run on "Shiny", for instance on [shinyapps.io](http://http://www.shinyapps.io/).

To run the App yourself, in addition to "Shiny" server, you need the dataset which is available from:
 * http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.rr138/1

The dataset must be placed in the same folder as 'ui.R' and 'server.R' and _must_ be called 'RFFT reference sample.sav'.
